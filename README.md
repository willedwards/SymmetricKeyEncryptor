Usage

Look at the unit test !!

I wrote this for myself at the airport because:

1) To have security, you need a program running locally. (Assume websites capture everything you put in - especially free ones)

2) I need to encrypt text, using the same key  - that I provide to decrypt it back again

3) Decent strength security
